The tags used to produce links are the <a> and </a>.

The <a> tells where the link should start and the </a> indicates where the link ends.

Everything between these two will work as a link.

The target of the link is added to the <a> tag using
the href="http://www.whateverpage.com" setting.

The example below shows how to make the word here work as a link to yahoo.

Click <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">here</a> to go to yahoo.

http://google.com http://altavista.com https://duckduckgo.com
http://yahoo.com http://www.yahoo.com
You simply:

    Specify the target in the <a href=" ">.


    Then add the text that should work as a link.


    Finally add an </a> tag to indicate where the link ends.
